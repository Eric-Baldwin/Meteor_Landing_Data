----- What is the shape of your dataset (rows, columns)?

45,716 x 10



----- Describe the available fields.

There are 8 categorical fields (name, id, nametype, recclass, fall, reclat, reclong, GeoLocation)

name: Represents the name of the entity.
id: Represents a unique identifier for the entity.
nametype: Represents the type of name.
recclass: Represents the classification of the entity.
fall: Represents whether the entity fell or was found.
reclat: Represents the latitude as text.
reclong: Represents the longitude as text.
GeoLocation: Represents the geographical location.

There are 2 quantitative fields (mass, year)

mass (g): Represents the mass in grams.
year: Represents the year as a floating timestamp.

There is some missing data but not enough to hinder analysis in my opinion.

Missing data points:
name                0
id                  0
nametype            0
recclass            0
mass (g)            131
fall                0
year                291
reclat              7315
reclong             7315
GeoLocation         7315

The data has not been summarized. This is raw data.



----- Potential avenues of inquiry

What is the average mass of a meteorite that is observed?

Is there a min mass a meteorite has in order to be found?

Are there areas on the globe where meteorites strike more than others?

Are meteorites being found more in the current time or in the past?

What percent of observed meteorites are found?

Are meteorites found in certain places more than others?





----- Value proposition

Stakeholders may want to aquire fallen meteorites. By studying data about where they fall, how big they are and where they are found, there might be a way to focus on certain areas of the globe which have a higher chance of collecting fallen meteorites.
